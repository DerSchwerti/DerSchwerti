- 👋 Hi, I’m @DerSchwerti
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to Code and build something with it!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning multiple things, Phyton is my first Step into Coding.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some little Phyton Projects where i can learn some more Stuff, trying gives more back than just learning Stuff.
- 📫 How to reach me: Send me a message here on GitHub i think :)

- Im looking forward to code some Stuff so i can upload it here, but i think it could take some time bc i need to learn it first and try it out.
- I am from Germany so English is not my native Language but i try my best to not make any spelling mistakes :D

- Have a great Day !!!
